What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
I'ts transforms the current folder to a git folder and create a subfolder named .git
We need to initialize the repository for the git starts to save the history of that files.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area keep the changes who will enter in the next commit. Working directory show all the files of that repository.
With staging area, we can control who enters in the commit and who's not.
